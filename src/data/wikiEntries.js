Most of these particles are blocked by Earth's magnetic shield, but some sneak in near the poles. When these particles hit oxygen and nitrogen gases high in the sky, they make the gases light up in green, red, blue, and purple colors." },

Scientists study space weather to predict when these events might happen and help protect our technology and astronauts." },

Space weather is the bigger picture that includes solar storms, auroras, solar wind, and all the ways the Sun's activity affects the space around us.

The electrically charged gas can affect magnetic field lines, causing the lines to twist, turn, and tangle up as the plasma moves. These magnetic snarls prevent heat from flowing to the surface, creating darker, cooler regions — the sunspots. They are often around 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit while the rest of the photosphere is around 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit." },
      { subtitle: "Sunspot Groups Are Often Associated with Active Regions", text: "Active regions are areas on the Sun where strong magnetic field lines extend into the solar atmosphere. Because of this, scientists often find sunspots in the same area as active regions. Solar eruptions, like solar flares and coronal mass ejections, typically burst from these active regions. Scientists study the regions where activity occurs because those storms can impact spacecraft, astronauts, and infrastructure on Earth." },

As the Sun moves through its natural cycle, in which its activity rises and falls roughly every 11 years, sunspots rise and fall in number, too. NASA and NOAA track sunspots to determine, and predict, the progress of the solar cycle — and ultimately, solar activity. Solar minimum is characterized by a low number of sunspots, while solar maximum is marked by many sunspots. Solar Cycle 25, the 25th solar cycle since scientists started tracking them, began in 2019." }
